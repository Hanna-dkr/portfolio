                                part of an MVP—within three months.
                                As a Senior UX Consultant at Pondo, I designed a scalable alerts framework and defined
                                clear, consistent messaging patterns. The challenge was aligning with developer mental
                                models—supporting awareness without disrupting flow. The MVP shipped on time, laying the
                                groundwork for future growth.

                                                        Without real validation, you risk designing for assumptions
